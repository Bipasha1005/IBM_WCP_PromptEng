# 🌿 LeafMind – EcoSync: AI for Sustainable Plant Care

**EcoSync** is an AI-powered virtual assistant developed under the LeafMind brand to support sustainable urban gardening. Built as part of a **Prompt Engineering** challenge (IBM WCP), it simulates smart plant care without any IoT or hardware — purely using prompt design and conversational AI.

> ⚠️ This is not an IoT or electronics project — it’s a **Prompt Engineering simulation**, demonstrated through frontend UI and prompt outputs. All the names used here are imaginary.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Generate prompts for product features, user guidance, and investor pitches
- Design a frontend landing page for a virtual plant-care solution

---

## 🌿 Key Features (AI-generated Concepts)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 AI Plant Advisor | Suggests care routines based on plant type & region |
| 💧 Smart Watering | Avoid overwatering/underwatering with AI-generated tips |
| 🌡️ Climate Sync | Guides optimal temperature and humidity conditions |
| 🌍 Ecosystem Matching | Recommends compatible plants for natural balance |
| 🪴 Urban Garden Focus | Tailored for balconies and small-space gardeners |

## 🖥️ Live Frontend Overview

The project includes a full frontend demo (`index.html`) structured as a product landing page:

- **Navbar**: Brand name and section links
- **Hero Section**: Promotional banner with CTA
- **Features Section**: Three major plant-care benefits with images
- **Call-to-Action**: Direct "Order Now" pitch
- **Footer**: Branding info

> See `/images/` for visual assets and `style.css` for theme styling.

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Samples

Prompts used include:

- “You are GreenGuardian, a balcony gardening expert. Recommend care steps for tomatoes and basil in Delhi.”
- “Generate a product pitch for an AI-powered plant advisor named EcoSync.”
- “List 3 competitive features of EcoSync over traditional self-watering pots.”

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
- **Prompt Layer**: Manual prompt crafting for LLMs (like ChatGPT/GPT-4)
- **No Backend/IoT**: This is a simulation project using NLP only

---

## 💼 Use Cases

- **Product Simulation**: For green-tech startup ideas
- **Prompt Engineering Practice**: For hackathons, IBM WCP, or GenAI roles
- **UX Showpiece**: Demonstrates how AI tools can power frontend storytelling

---

## 📈 Future Directions

- Build an interactive chatbot UI on top of the current frontend
- Support voice commands using Web Speech API + LLM prompts
- Localized prompts (Hindi, Bengali, etc.) for regional plant advice
- Integration with visual plant diagnosis models (mocked or real)
